# Article-Finder
This is an application that gives you the opportunity to match text and return a list of articles from database that matches the input.
When you choose an article from the result you also get a suggestion on similar articles.
ItÂ´s possible to add a new article with URL and title into the database. (It has to be a PDF file)
NLP SpaCy then breaks down the PDF to string text and summarizes the text into a shorter paragraph.
